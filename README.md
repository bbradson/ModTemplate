RimWorld Mod Template  
  
All folders except for About are optional and should be deleted when not used. Each folder has readme files and comments with short explanations in every other file. C# development starts in the Source folder.  
xml comments look like this:
```
<!-- comment here -->
```
Some optional fields are commented out like this. To enable them you remove the surrounding arrows.  
  
The recommended way for optional mod support is through LoadFolders, which is explained in Tynan's official guide here: https://docs.google.com/document/d/1_DmcLpIvHIQ5AxVLYrn9_iwkOqArlgcWcyE_6RSDG6M
