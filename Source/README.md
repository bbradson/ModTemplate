This folder does not get loaded by the game. Instead it's here for development of C# mods. ModTemplate.csproj is an xml file that can and should be edited with an xml editor of your choice, or even notepad. Its name is what ends up getting picked as assembly name, unless something else is specified inside. It contains fields like the author name and dependencies too.  
  
To start developing after setting names for your project simply open the file with an IDE like Visual Studio. The newest Community Edition is recommended. References to RimWorld and Harmony are already set. When installing VS for the first time, pick the .NET desktop development option. You might have to restart your IDE once or just hit build if it throws nonsensical errors about missing dependencies.  
  
When publishing, make sure to not include the auto-generated obj, bin and .vs folders. Those contain large local cache files with contents specific to the computer they were generated on.
