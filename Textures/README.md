Place textures here.  
Paths as referenced by defs start inside this folder and have to be unique. All Textures folders essentially get merged when in-game. Supported formats are png, jpg and psd when not using additional mods. dds support gets added by certain mods. Texture dimensions have to be multiples of 4 to not cause issues in-game. Vanilla Expanded uses 128x128p per in-game tile, which is set with the drawSize field in xml. Some prefer higher resolutions like 256p per tile. Even higher resolutions are practically impossible to fully display on modern monitors, even using Camera+, and require unreasonable amounts of VRAM.  
  
Shortest load times and highest quality is achieved through dds, but png is recommended when just starting out. Rimpy and Rimsort can convert all png files to dds in a way that mods with dds support load correctly, without turning them into a requirement.  
  
The wiki has a couple tutorials for texture creation.  
Oskar Potocki has a youtube channel where he shows his workflow with Adobe Illustrator, here: https://www.youtube.com/@OskarPotockiVE/videos  
Affinity Designer, Inkscape and Krita often get recommended too. Don't use paint or gimp.
