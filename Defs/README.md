Defs go here. Refer to core game files or other mods for examples. File and subfolder names can be chosen freely, the game merges them all together when loading.  
  
Every file needs at a minimum this, with all its defs wrapped inbetween the two Defs tags:  
```
<?xml version="1.0" encoding="utf-8" ?>
<Defs>

</Defs>
```
